                TINKER Notes for GNU gfortran on Macintosh OS X
                -----------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on a Macintosh OS X
         system using the GNU gfortran Fortran compiler under OpenMP
         parallelization.

         Note including the -static-libgcc flag at link time causes
         use of static versions of most system libraries. An exception
         is libquadmath. There is a static version of this library,
         libquadmath.a, and its use can be enforced by renaming the
         shared versions libquadmath.dylib and libquadmath.0.dylib in
         the /usr/local/lib directory.

         If some or all of the executables fail via a segmentation
         fault, check the limits for your processes by issuing the
         "limit" command at the tcsh shell prompt (or similar under
         other shells). By default, these limits are set to quite small
         values. To eliminate the problem issue the following commands:

                        limit datasize unlimited
                        limit stacksize unlimited

         These same commands can also be put in your .tcshrc file or
         equivalent startup file to be run at login time.
